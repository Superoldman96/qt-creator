    \brief Contains a general purpose TaskTree library.

    Use the TaskTree library to construct recipes, describing what
    asynchronous  tasks are to be executed, and use these recipes
    within QTaskTree to execute them.

    The recipes are declarative descriptions on what task types
    are to be created and executed, e.g.: QProcess, QNetworkReplyWrapper,
    or QConcurrentCall<ReturnType>, or whether they should run in sequence
    or in parallel. Inside recipes you may define different continuation
    paths depending on whether the previous task finished with success
    or an error. It's also possible to nest tasks in
    \l {QtTaskTree::} {Group} elements, and each
    \l {QtTaskTree::} {Group} may run its tasks according to
    it's own execution mode or workflow policy.
    The recipes form the task tree structures.

    \section1 Asynchronous Tasks

    Asynchronous task is any task that can be started, and \e later it
    finishes with success or an error. \e Later means that after starting
    the task, the control goes back to the running event loop.
    We donâ€™t block the caller thread until the task is finished.
    In order to use the task tree we need an event loop spinning.

    Examples of asynchronous Tasks:
    \list
        \li QTimer::singleShot()
        \li QProcess
        \li QNetworkAccessManager + QNetworkReply = QNetworkReplyWrapper
        \li QtConcurrent::run() + QFutureWatcher<Result>
            = QConcurrentCall<Result>
    \endlist

    \section1 Recipe & Task Tree

    In order to memorize what the recipe and task tree is, let's use
    the analogy to the cartridge and player. When we write a recipe,
    it's like we would be constructing a cartridge, so we just prepare
    a detailed description on what the player should do later,
    when the cartridge is placed inside a player (task tree) and started.
    The recipe itself is just a declarative description for the task tree
    on what the task tree should do when the recipe is passed to the
    task tree and the task tree is started. The recipe itself doesn't do
    anything on its own without a task tree - it's like a cartridge
    without a player.

    Here is a short summary about recipe and task tree responsibilities.

    Recipe (cartridge) describes:
    \list
        \li what tasks are to be created dynamically by the running
            task tree (via QCustomTask)
        \li in which order
        \li what data structures are to be created dynamically by the running
            task tree (via \l {QtTaskTree::} {Storage})
        \li how to setup each task before start
        \li how to collect data when tasks are finished
        \li execution mode (tasks should run in sequence or in parallel)
        \li workflow policy
    \endlist

    Task tree (player):
    \list
        \li reads the recipe and creates tasks and data structures
            automatically
        \li manages the lifetime of created tasks and data structures
        \li executes continuations
        \li chooses different paths depending on results of finished tasks
            and workflow policies
        \li provides basic progress info
    \endlist

    \section1 Custom Tasks

    Since the recipe is a description for the task tree on what tasks it should
    create when the task tree is started, we can't create these tasks directly
    inside a recipe. Instead, we need a declarative way to tell the task tree
    to create and start these tasks for us at later point in time. For example,
    if we want the task tree to create and start QProcess, we describe it
    by placing QProcessTask element inside a recipe. The QProcessTask is an
    alias to the QCustomTask<QProcess>. Each task Type should provide
    its corresponding QCustomTask<Type> so that it may be used inside recipes.

    The following table shows some build-in custom tasks ready to be placed
    inside recipes:

    \table
    \header
        \li Custom Task (used in recipes)
        \li Task Class (created by the running task tree)
        \li Brief Description
    \row
        \li QProcessTask
        \li QProcess
        \li Starts process.
    \row
        \li QConcurrentCallTask<ReturnType>
        \li QConcurrentCall<ReturnType>
        \li Starts asynchronous task, runs in separate thread.
    \row
        \li QTaskTreeTask
        \li QTaskTree
        \li Starts nested task tree.
    \row
        \li QNetworkReplyWrapperTask
        \li QNetworkReplyWrapper
        \li Starts network download.
    \row
        \li QTcpSocketWrapperTask
        \li QTcpSocketWrapper
        \li Starts a TCP connection.
    \endtable

    See QTaskInterface and \l {Task Adapters} for more information on
    how to adapt particular task to be used inside recipes.

    \section1 Example Recipe

    The QTaskTree has a top level Group element, a.k.a recipe, which may
    contain any number of tasks of various types, such as QProcessTask,
    QNetworkReplyWrapperTask, or QConcurrentCallTask<ReturnType>:

    \code
        const Group recipe {
            QProcessTask(...),
            QNetworkReplyWrapperTask(...),
            QConcurrentCallTask<int>(...)
        };

        QTaskTree *taskTree = new QTaskTree(recipe);
        connect(taskTree, &QTaskTree::done, ...);  // finish handler
        taskTree->start();
    \endcode

    The recipe above consist of a top level element of the Group type that
    contains tasks of the QProcessTask, QNetworkReplyWrapperTask,
    and QConcurrentCallTask<int> type. After taskTree->start() is called,
    the tasks are created and run in a chain, starting with QProcess.
    When the QProcess finishes successfully, the QNetworkReplyWrapper
    task is started. Finally, when the network task finishes successfully,
    the QConcurrentCall<int> task is started.

    When the last running task finishes with success, the task tree is
    considered to have run successfully and the QTaskTree::done() signal
    is emitted with \l {QtTaskTree::} {DoneWith::Success}.
    When a task finishes with an error, the execution of the task tree
    is stopped and the remaining tasks are skipped. The task tree finishes
    with an error and sends the QTaskTree::done() signal with
    \l {QtTaskTree::} {DoneWith::Error}.

    \section1 Groups

    The parent of the \l {QtTaskTree::} {Group} sees it as a single task.
    Like other tasks, the group can be started and it can finish with
    success or an error. The \l {QtTaskTree::} {Group} elements
    can be nested to create a tree structure:

    \code
        const Group recipe {
            Group {
                parallel,
                QProcessTask(...),
                QConcurrentCallTask<int>(...)
            },
            QNetworkReplyWrapperTask(...)
        };
    \endcode

    The example above differs from the first example in that the top level
    element has a subgroup that contains the QProcessTask and
    QConcurrentCallTask<int>. The subgroup is a sibling element of the
    QNetworkReplyWrapperTask in the root. The subgroup contains an
    additional \e parallel element that instructs its Group to execute
    its tasks in parallel.

    So, when the QTaskTree starts the recipe above, the QProcess and
    QConcurrentCall<int> start immediately and run in parallel.
    Since the root group doesn't contain a \e parallel element,
    its direct child tasks are run in sequence. Thus, the
    QNetworkReplyWrapper starts when the whole subgroup finishes. The group is
    considered as finished when all its tasks have finished.
    The order in which the tasks finish is not relevant.

    So, depending on which task lasts longer
    (QProcess or QConcurrentCall<int>), the following scenarios can take place:

    \table
    \header
        \li Scenario 1
        \li Scenario 2
    \row
        \li Root Group starts
        \li Root Group starts
    \row
        \li Sub Group starts
        \li Sub Group starts
    \row
        \li QProcess starts
        \li QProcess starts
    \row
        \li QConcurrentCall<int> starts
        \li QConcurrentCall<int> starts
    \row
        \li ...
        \li ...
    \row
        \li \b {QProcess finishes}
        \li \b {QConcurrentCall<int> finishes}
    \row
        \li ...
        \li ...
    \row
        \li \b {QConcurrentCall<int> finishes}
        \li \b {QProcess finishes}
    \row
        \li Sub Group finishes
        \li Sub Group finishes
    \row
        \li QNetworkReplyWrapper starts
        \li QNetworkReplyWrapper starts
    \row
        \li ...
        \li ...
    \row
        \li QNetworkReplyWrapper finishes
        \li QNetworkReplyWrapper finishes
    \row
        \li Root Group finishes
        \li Root Group finishes
    \endtable

    The differences between the scenarios are marked with bold. Three dots mean
    that an unspecified amount of time passes between previous and next events
    (a task or tasks continue to run). No dots between events
    means that they occur synchronously.

    The presented scenarios assume that all tasks run successfully. If a task
    fails during execution, the task tree finishes with an error.
    In particular, when QProcess finishes with an error while
    QConcurrentCall<int> is still being executed, the QConcurrentCall<int>
    is automatically canceled, the subgroup finishes with an error,
    the QNetworkReplyWrapper is skipped, and the tree finishes with an error.

    \section1 Task Handlers

    Use Task handlers to set up a task for execution and to enable reading
    the output data from the task when it finishes with success or an error.

    \section2 Task's Start Handler

    When a task object is created and before it's started,
    the task tree invokes an optionally user-provided setup handler.
    The setup handler should always take a \e reference to the associated
    task class object:

    \code
        const auto onSetup = [](QProcess &process) {
            process.setProgram("sleep");
            process.setArguments({"3"});
        };
        const Group root {
            QProcessTask(onSetup)
        };
    \endcode

    You can modify the passed QProcess in the setup handler, so that the task
    tree can start the process according to your configuration.
    You should not call \c {process.start();} in the setup handler,
    as the task tree calls it when needed. The setup handler is optional.
    When used, it must be the first argument of the task's constructor.

    Optionally, the setup handler may return a
    \l {QtTaskTree::} {SetupResult}. The returned
    \l {QtTaskTree::} {SetupResult} influences the further
    start behavior of a given task. The possible values are:

    \table
    \header
        \li \l {QtTaskTree::} {SetupResult} Value
        \li Brief Description
    \row
        \li \l {QtTaskTree::SetupResult::} {Continue}
        \li The task will be started normally. This is the default behavior
            when the setup handler doesn't return
            \l {QtTaskTree::} {SetupResult}
            (that is, its return type is void).
    \row
        \li \l {QtTaskTree::SetupResult::} {StopWithSuccess}
        \li The task won't be started and it will report success to its parent.
    \row
        \li \l {QtTaskTree::SetupResult::} {StopWithError}
        \li The task won't be started and it will report an error to its parent.
    \endtable

    This is useful for running a task only when a condition is met and the data
    needed to evaluate this condition is not known until previously
    started tasks finish. In this way, the setup handler dynamically
    decides whether to start the corresponding task normally or skip it
    and report success or an error. For more information about inter-task
    data exchange, see \l {QtTaskTree::} {Storage}.

    \section2 Task's Done Handler

    When a running task finishes, the task tree invokes an optionally
    provided done handler. The handler should take a \c const \e reference
    to the associated task class object:

    \code
        const auto onSetup = [](QProcess &process) {
            process.setProgram("sleep");
            process.setArguments({"3"});
        };
        const auto onDone = [](const QProcess &process, DoneWith result) {
            if (result == DoneWith::Success)
                qDebug() << "Success" << process.cleanedStdOut();
            else
                qDebug() << "Failure" << process.cleanedStdErr();
        };
        const Group root {
            QProcessTask(onSetup, onDone)
        };
    \endcode

    The done handler may collect output data from QProcess, and store it
    for further processing or perform additional actions.

    \note If the task setup handler returns
          \l {QtTaskTree::SetupResult::} {StopWithSuccess} or
          \l {QtTaskTree::SetupResult::} {StopWithError},
          the done handler is not invoked.

    \section1 Group Handlers

    Similarly to task handlers, group handlers enable you to set up a group to
    execute and to apply more actions when the whole group finishes with
    success or an error.

    \section2 Group's Start Handler

    The task tree invokes the group start handler before it starts the child
    tasks. The group handler doesn't take any arguments:

    \code
        const auto onSetup = [] {
            qDebug() << "Entering the group";
        };
        const Group root {
            onGroupSetup(onSetup),
            QProcessTask(...)
        };
    \endcode

    The group setup handler is optional. To define a group setup handler,
    add an \l {QtTaskTree::} {onGroupSetup()} element to a group.
    The argument of \l {QtTaskTree::} {onGroupSetup()} is a user
    handler. If you add more than one
    \l {QtTaskTree::} {onGroupSetup()} element to a group,
    an assert is triggered at runtime that includes an error message.

    Like the task's start handler, the group start handler may return
    \l {QtTaskTree::} {SetupResult}.
    The returned \l {QtTaskTree::} {SetupResult} value affects
    the start behavior of the whole group. If you do not specify
    a group start handler, or its return type is void,
    the default group's action is \l {QtTaskTree::SetupResult::} {Continue},
    so that all tasks are started normally.
    Otherwise, when the start handler returns
    \l {QtTaskTree::SetupResult::} {StopWithSuccess} or
    \l {QtTaskTree::SetupResult::} {StopWithError},
    the tasks are not started (they are skipped) and the group itself
    reports success or an error, depending on the returned value, respectively.

    \code
        const Group root {
            onGroupSetup([] { qDebug() << "Root setup"; }),
            Group {
                onGroupSetup([] { qDebug() << "Group 1 setup"; return SetupResult::Continue; }),
                QProcessTask(...) // Process 1
            },
            Group {
                onGroupSetup([] { qDebug() << "Group 2 setup"; return SetupResult::StopWithSuccess; }),
                QProcessTask(...) // Process 2
            },
            Group {
                onGroupSetup([] { qDebug() << "Group 3 setup"; return SetupResult::StopWithError; }),
                QProcessTask(...) // Process 3
            },
            QProcessTask(...) // Process 4
        };
    \endcode

    In the above example, all subgroups of a root group define their
    setup handlers. The following scenario assumes that all started
    processes finish with success:

    \table
    \header
        \li Scenario
        \li Comment
    \row
        \li Root Group starts
        \li Doesn't return SetupResult, so its tasks are executed.
    \row
        \li Group 1 starts
        \li Returns Continue, so its tasks are executed.
    \row
        \li Process 1 starts
        \li
    \row
        \li ...
        \li ...
    \row
        \li Process 1 finishes (success)
        \li
    \row
        \li Group 1 finishes (success)
        \li
    \row
        \li Group 2 starts
        \li Returns StopWithSuccess, so Process 2 is skipped and Group 2
            reports success.
    \row
        \li Group 2 finishes (success)
        \li
    \row
        \li Group 3 starts
        \li Returns StopWithError, so Process 3 is skipped and Group 3
            reports an error.
    \row
        \li Group 3 finishes (error)
        \li
    \row
        \li Root Group finishes (error)
        \li Group 3, which is a direct child of the root group,
            finished with an error, so the root group stops executing,
            skips Process 4, which has not started yet, and reports an error.
    \endtable

    \section2 Groups's Done Handler

    A \l {QtTaskTree::} {Group}'s done handler is executed after
    the successful or failed execution of its tasks.
    The final value reported by the group depends on its \l {Workflow Policy}.
    The handler can apply other necessary actions.
    The done handler is defined inside the \l {QtTaskTree::} {onGroupDone()}
    element of a group. It may take the optional
    \l {QtTaskTree::} {DoneWith} argument, indicating
    the successful or failed execution:

    \code
        const Group root {
            onGroupSetup([] { qDebug() << "Root setup"; }),
            QProcessTask(...),
            onGroupDone([](DoneWith result) {
                if (result == DoneWith::Success)
                    qDebug() << "Root finished with success";
                else
                    qDebug() << "Root finished with an error";
            })
        };
    \endcode

    The group done handler is optional. If you add more than one
    \l {QtTaskTree::} {onGroupDone()} to a group,
    an assert is triggered at runtime that includes an error message.

    \note Even if the group setup handler returns
    \l {QtTaskTree::SetupResult::} {StopWithSuccess} or
    \l {QtTaskTree::SetupResult::} {StopWithError},
    the group's done handler is invoked. This behavior differs from that
    of task done handler and might change in the future.

    \section1 Other Group Elements

    A group can contain other elements that describe the processing flow,
    such as the execution mode or workflow policy. It can also contain
    storage elements that are responsible for collecting and sharing
    custom common data gathered during group execution.

    \section2 Execution Mode

    The execution mode element in a Group specifies how the direct
    child tasks of the Group are started. The most common execution modes are
    \l {QtTaskTree::} {sequential} and
    \l {QtTaskTree::} {parallel}. It's also possible to specify
    the limit of tasks running in parallel by using the
    \l {QtTaskTree::} {ParallelLimit} element.

    In all execution modes, a group starts tasks in the oder
    in which they appear.

    If a child of a group is also a group, the child group runs its tasks
    according to its own execution mode.

    \section2 Workflow Policy

    The workflow policy element in a \l {QtTaskTree::} {Group}
    specifies how the group should behave when any of its \e direct
    child's tasks finish. For a detailed description of possible policies,
    refer to \l {QtTaskTree::} {WorkflowPolicy}.

    If a child of a group is also a group, the child group runs its tasks
    according to its own workflow policy.

    \section2 Storage

    Use the \l {QtTaskTree::} {Storage} element to exchange
    information between tasks. Especially, in the sequential execution mode,
    when a task needs data from another, already finished task,
    before it can start. For example, a task tree that copies data
    by reading it from a source and writing it to a destination
    might look as follows:

    \code
        static QByteArray load(const QString &fileName) { ... }
        static void save(const QString &fileName, const QByteArray &array) { ... }

        static Group copyRecipe(const QString &source, const QString &destination)
        {
            struct CopyStorage { // [1] custom inter-task struct
                QByteArray content; // [2] custom inter-task data
            };

            // [3] instance of custom inter-task struct manageable by task tree
            const Storage<CopyStorage> storage;

            const auto onLoaderSetup = [source](QConcurrentCall<QByteArray> &async) {
                async.setConcurrentCallData(&load, source);
            };
            // [4] runtime: task tree activates the instance from [7] before invoking handler
            const auto onLoaderDone = [storage](const QConcurrentCall<QByteArray> &async) {
                storage->content = async.result(); // [5] loader stores the result in storage
            };

            // [4] runtime: task tree activates the instance from [7] before invoking handler
            const auto onSaverSetup = [storage, destination](QConcurrentCall<void> &async) {
                const QByteArray content = storage->content; // [6] saver takes data from storage
                async.setConcurrentCallData(&save, destination, content);
            };
            const auto onSaverDone = [](const QConcurrentCall<void> &async) {
                qDebug() << "Save done successfully";
            };

            const Group root {
                // [7] runtime: task tree creates an instance of CopyStorage when root is entered
                storage,
                QConcurrentCallTask<QByteArray>(onLoaderSetup, onLoaderDone, CallDone::OnSuccess),
                QConcurrentCallTask<void>(onSaverSetup, onSaverDone, CallDone::OnSuccess)
            };
            return root;
        }

        ...

        const QString source = ...;
        const QString destination = ...;
        QTaskTree taskTree(copyRecipe(source, destination));
        connect(&taskTree, &QTaskTree::done, &taskTree, [](DoneWith result) {
            if (result == DoneWith::Success)
                qDebug() << "The copying finished successfully.";
        });
        tasktree.start();
    \endcode

    In the example above, the inter-task data consists of a QByteArray content
    variable [2] enclosed in a \c CopyStorage custom struct [1]. If the loader
    finishes successfully, it stores the data in a \c CopyStorage::content
    variable [5]. The saver then uses the variable to configure the
    saving task [6].

    To enable a task tree to manage the \c CopyStorage struct, an instance of
    \l {QtTaskTree::} {Storage}<\c {CopyStorage}> is created [3].
    If a copy of this object is inserted as the group's child item [7],
    an instance of the \c CopyStorage struct is created dynamically
    when the task tree enters this group. When the task tree leaves this group,
    the existing instance of the \c CopyStorage struct is destructed
    as it's no longer needed.

    If several task trees holding a copy of the common
    \l {QtTaskTree::} {Storage}<\c {CopyStorage}> instance run
    simultaneously (including the case when the task trees are run
    in different threads), each task tree contains its own copy of
    the \c CopyStorage struct.

    You can access \c CopyStorage from any handler in the group with
    a storage object. This includes all handlers of all descendant tasks
    of the group with a storage object. To access the custom struct
    in a handler, pass the copy of the
    \l {QtTaskTree::} {Storage}<\c {CopyStorage}> object to the handler
    (for example, in a lambda capture) [4].

    When the task tree invokes a handler in a subtree containing
    the storage [7], the task tree activates its own \c CopyStorage
    instance inside the \l {QtTaskTree::} {Storage}<\c {CopyStorage}>
    object. Therefore, the \c CopyStorage struct may be accessed
    only from within the handler body. To access the currently active
    \c CopyStorage from within
    \l {QtTaskTree::} {Storage}<\c {CopyStorage}>, use the
    \l {QtTaskTree::} {Storage::operator->()},
    \l {QtTaskTree::} {Storage::operator*()}, or
    \l {QtTaskTree::} {Storage::activeStorage()}
       method.

    The following list summarizes how to employ a Storage object into the task
    tree:
    \list 1
        \li Define the custom structure \c MyStorage with custom data [1], [2]
        \li Create an instance of the \l {QtTaskTree::}
            {Storage}<\c {MyStorage}> storage [3]
        \li Pass the \l {QtTaskTree::} {Storage}<\c {MyStorage}>
            instance to handlers [4]
        \li Access the \c MyStorage instance in handlers [5], [6]
        \li Insert the \l {QtTaskTree::} {Storage}<\c {MyStorage}>
            instance into a group [7]
    \endlist

    \section1 QTaskTree class

    QTaskTree executes the tree structure of asynchronous tasks according
    to the recipe described by the \l {QtTaskTree::} {Group}
    root element.

    As QTaskTree is also an asynchronous task, it can be a part of another
    QTaskTree. To place a nested QTaskTree inside another QTaskTree,
    insert the QTaskTreeTask element into another
    \l {QtTaskTree::} {Group} element.

    QTaskTree reports progress of completed tasks when running.
    The progress value is increased when a task finishes or is skipped
    or canceled. When QTaskTree is finished and the QTaskTree::done()
    signal is emitted, the current value of the progress equals the
    maximum progress value. Maximum progress equals the total number
    of asynchronous tasks in a tree. A nested QTaskTree is counted
    as a single task, and its child tasks are not counted in the
    top level tree. Groups themselves are not counted as tasks,
    but their tasks are counted. \l QSyncTask tasks are not asynchronous,
    so they are not counted as tasks.

    To set additional initial data for the running tree, modify the storage
    instances in a tree when it creates them by installing a storage setup
    handler:

    \code
        Storage<CopyStorage> storage;
        const Group root = ...; // storage placed inside root's group and inside handlers
        QTaskTree taskTree(root);
        auto initStorage = [](CopyStorage &storage) {
            storage.content = "initial content";
        };
        taskTree.onStorageSetup(storage, initStorage);
        taskTree.start();
    \endcode

    When the running task tree creates a \c CopyStorage instance,
    and before any handler inside a tree is called, the task tree calls
    the \c initStorage handler, to enable setting up initial data
    of the storage, unique to this particular run of taskTree.

    Similarly, to collect some additional result data from the running tree,
    read it from storage instances in the tree when they are about to be
    destroyed. To do this, install a storage done handler:

    \code
        Storage<CopyStorage> storage;
        const Group root = ...; // storage placed inside root's group and inside handlers
        QTaskTree taskTree(root);
        auto collectStorage = [](const CopyStorage &storage) {
            qDebug() << "final content" << storage.content;
        };
        taskTree.onStorageDone(storage, collectStorage);
        taskTree.start();
    \endcode

    When the running task tree is about to destroy a \c CopyStorage instance,
    the task tree calls the collectStorage handler, to enable reading
    the final data from the storage, unique to this particular run of taskTree.

    \section1 Task Adapters

    Allowing new Task types to be a part of recipes is quite easy.
    It's enough to define a new task alias to the QCustomTask template,
    passing your Task type as a first template argument, like:

    \code
        class Worker : public QObject
        {
        public:
            void start() { ... }

        signals:
            void done(bool result);
        };

        using WorkerTask = QCustomTask<Worker>;
    \endcode

    This is going to work, if the following conditions are met:
    \list 1
        \li Your task is derived from QObject.
        \li Your task has public start() method that starts the task.
        \li Your task emits done(bool) or
            done(\l {QtTaskTree::} {DoneResult}) signal
            when it's finished.
    \endlist

    If your task doesn't meet these conditions, you may still adapt your
    task to work with the TaskTree framework, by providing a second
    template argument with the custom adapter.
    Let's say, we want to adapt QTimer to work with TaskTree.
    The Adapter could look like:

    \code
        class TimerAdapter
        {
        public:
            void operator()(QTimer *task, QTaskInterface *iface) {
                task->setSingleShot(true);
                QObject::connect(task, &QTimer::timeout, iface, [iface] {
                    iface->reportDone(DoneResult::Success);
                });
                task->start();
            }
        };

        using TimerTask = QCustomTask<QTimer, TimerAdapter>;
    \endcode

    Now you may start using the TimerTask in your recipes, like:

    \code
        const auto onSetup = [](QTimer &task) {
            task.setInterval(2000);
        };

        const auto onDone = [](const QTimer &task) {
            qDebug() << "Timer triggered after" << task.interval() << "ms.";
        };

        const Group recipe {
            TimerTask(onSetup, onDone)
        };
    \endcode

    \note The class implementing the running task should have
    a default constructor, and objects of this class should be
    freely destructible. It should be allowed to destroy a running task,
    preferably without waiting for the running task to finish
    (that is, safe non-blocking destructor of a running task).
    To achieve a non-blocking destruction of a task that has
    a blocking destructor, consider using the optional \c Deleter
    template parameter of the QCustomTask (the third template argument).

    GroupItem is a basic element that may be a part of any
    \l {QtTaskTree::} {Group}. It encapsulates the functionality
    provided by any GroupItem's subclass.
    It is a value type and it is safe to copy the GroupItem instance,

            Asynchronous tasks are the main reason for using a task tree.
    \row
        \li \l {QtTaskTree::} {Group}
        \li A container for other group items. Since the group is of the

/*!
    \class QtTaskTree::Group
    \inheaderfile qtasktree.h
    \inmodule TaskTree
    \brief Group represents the basic element for composing declarative
           recipes describing how to execute and handle a nested tree
           of asynchronous tasks.
    \reentrant

    Group is a container for other group items. It encloses child tasks
    into one unit, which is seen by the group's parent as a single,
    asynchronous task. Since Group is of the GroupItem type,
    it may also be a child of Group.

    Insert child tasks into the group by using aliased custom task names,
    such as, QConcurrentCallTask<ResultType> or QNetworkReplyWrapperTask:

    \code
        const Group group {
            QNetworkReplyWrapperTask(...),
            QConcurrentCallTask<int>(...)
        };
    \endcode

    You can customize the group's behavior by inserting the
    \l {QtTaskTree::}{ExecutionMode} or
    \l {QtTaskTree::}{WorkflowPolicy} items:

    \code
        const Group group {
            parallel,
            continueOnError,
            QNetworkReplyWrapperTask(...),
            QNetworkReplyWrapperTask(...)
        };
    \endcode

    The group may contain nested groups:

    \code
        const Group group {
            finishAllAndSuccess,
            QNetworkReplyWrapperTask(...),
            Group {
                QNetworkReplyWrapperTask(...),
                Group {
                    parallel,
                    QNetworkReplyWrapperTask(...),
                    QNetworkReplyWrapperTask(...),
                }
                QConcurrentCallTask<QString>(...)
            }
        };
    \endcode

    The group may dynamically instantiate a custom storage structure,
    which may be used for inter-task data exchange:

    \code
        struct MyCustomStruct { QByteArray data; };

        Storage<MyCustomStruct> storage;

        const auto onFirstSetup = [](QNetworkReplyWrapper &task) { ... };
        const auto onFirstDone = [storage](const QNetworkReplyWrapper &task) {
            // storage-> gives a pointer to MyCustomStruct instance,
            // created dynamically by the running task tree.
            storage->data = task.reply()->readAll();
        };
        const auto onSecondSetup = [storage](QConcurrentCall<QImage> &task) {
            // storage-> gives a pointer to MyCustomStruct. Since the group is sequential,
            // the stored MyCustomStruct was already updated inside the onFirstDone handler.
            const QByteArray storedData = storage->data;
        };

        const Group group {
            // When the group is entered by a running task tree, it creates MyCustomStruct
            // instance dynamically. It is later accessible from all handlers via
            // the *storage or storage-> operators.
            sequential,
            storage,
            QNetworkReplyWrapperTask(onFirstSetup, onFirstDone, CallDone::OnSuccess),
            QConcurrentCallTask<QImage>(onSecondSetup)
        };
    \endcode
*/

/*!
    \enum QtTaskTree::WorkflowPolicy

    This enum describes the possible behavior of the Group element when any
    group's child task finishes its execution. It's also used when the
    running Group is canceled.

    \value StopOnError
        Default. Corresponds to the stopOnError global element.
        If any child task finishes with an error, the group stops and
        finishes with an error. If all child tasks finished with success,
        the group finishes with success. If a group is empty,
        it finishes with success.
    \value ContinueOnError
        Corresponds to the continueOnError global element.
        Similar to stopOnError, but in case any child finishes with an error,
        the execution continues until all tasks finish, and the group
        reports an error afterwards, even when some other tasks in the
        group finished with success. If all child tasks finish successfully,
        the group finishes with success. If a group is empty,
        it finishes with success.
    \value StopOnSuccess
        Corresponds to the stopOnSuccess global element.
        If any child task finishes with success, the group stops and
        finishes with success. If all child tasks finished with an error,
        the group finishes with an error. If a group is empty,
        it finishes with an error.
    \value ContinueOnSuccess
        Corresponds to the continueOnSuccess global element.
        Similar to stopOnSuccess, but in case any child finishes successfully,
        the execution continues until all tasks finish, and the group
        reports success afterwards, even when some other tasks in the group
        finished with an error. If all child tasks finish with an error,
        the group finishes with an error. If a group is empty,
        it finishes with an error.
    \value StopOnSuccessOrError
        Corresponds to the stopOnSuccessOrError global element.
        The group starts as many tasks as it can. When any task finishes,
        the group stops and reports the task's result.
        Useful only in parallel mode.
        In sequential mode, only the first task is started, and when finished,
        the group finishes too, so the other tasks are always skipped.
        If a group is empty, it finishes with an error.
    \value FinishAllAndSuccess
        Corresponds to the finishAllAndSuccess global element.
        The group executes all tasks and ignores their return results.
        When all tasks finished, the group finishes with success.
        If a group is empty, it finishes with success.
    \value FinishAllAndError
        Corresponds to the finishAllAndError global element.
        The group executes all tasks and ignores their return results.
        When all tasks finished, the group finishes with an error.
        If a group is empty, it finishes with an error.

    Whenever a child task's result causes the Group to stop, that is,
    in case of StopOnError, StopOnSuccess, or StopOnSuccessOrError policies,
    the Group cancels the other running child tasks
    (if any - for example in parallel mode), and skips executing tasks
    it has not started yet (for example, in the sequential mode -
    those, that are placed after the failed task). Both canceling and
    skipping child tasks may happen when ParallelLimit is used.

    The table below summarizes the differences between various
    workflow policies:

    \table
    \header
        \li \l WorkflowPolicy
        \li Executes all child tasks
        \li Result
        \li Result when the group is empty

        \li StopOnError
        \li Stops when any child task finished with an error and

        \li StopOnSuccessOrError
        \li Stops when any child task finished and reports child task's result
        \li Success or an error, depending on the finished child task's result
        \li An error
    \row
        \li FinishAllAndSuccess
        \li Yes
        \li Success

        \li FinishAllAndError
        \li Yes
        \li An error
        \li An error
    \endtable

    If a child of a group is also a group, the child group runs its tasks
    according to its own workflow policy. When a parent group stops the
    running child group because of parent group's workflow policy, that is,
    when the StopOnError, StopOnSuccess, or StopOnSuccessOrError
    policy was used for the parent, the child group's result is reported
    according to the \b Result column and to the
    \b {child group's workflow policy} row in the table above.

    \class QtTaskTree::Storage
    \inheaderfile qtasktree.h
    \inmodule TaskTree
    \brief A class template for custom data exchange in the running task tree.
    \reentrant

    The Storage class template is responsible for dynamically creating
    and destructing objects of the custom \c StorageStruct type.
    The creation and destruction are managed by the running task tree.
    If a Storage object is placed inside a \l {QtTaskTree::} {Group}
    element, the running task tree creates the \c StorageStruct object
    when the group is started and before the group's setup handler is called.
    Later, whenever any handler inside this group is called,
    the task tree activates the previously created instance of the
    \c StorageStruct object. This includes all tasks' and groups'
    setup and done handlers inside the group where the Storage object
    was placed, also within the nested groups. When a copy of the Storage
    object is passed to the handler via the lambda capture, the handler
    may access the instance activated by the running task tree via the
    \l {QtTaskTree::} {Storage::operator->()},
    \l {QtTaskTree::} {Storage::operator*()}, or activeStorage() method.
    If two handlers capture the same Storage object,
    one of them may store a custom data there, and the other may
    read it afterwards. When the group is finished, the previously created
    instance of the \c StorageStruct object is destroyed after the
    group's done handler is called.

    An example of data exchange between tasks:

    \code
        const Storage<QString> storage;

        const auto onFirstDone = [storage](const FirstWorker &task) {
            // Assings QString, taken from the first task result, to the active QString instance
            // of the Storage object.
            *storage = task.getResultAsString();
        };

        const auto onSecondSetup = [storage](SecondWorker &task) {
            // Reads QString from the active QString instance of the Storage object and use it to
            // configure the second task before start.
            task.configureWithString(*storage);
        };

        const Group root {
            // The running task tree creates QString instance when root in entered
            storage,
            // The done handler of the first task stores the QString in the storage
            FirstWorkerTask(..., onFirstDone),
            // The setup handler of the second task reads the QString from the storage
            SecondWorkerTask(onSecondSetup, ...)
        };
    \endcode

    Since the root group executes its tasks sequentially, the
    \c onFirstDone handler is always called before the
    \c onSecondSetup handler. This means that the QString data,
    read from the \c storage inside the \c onSecondSetup handler's body,
    has already been set by the \c onFirstDone handler.
    You can always rely on it in \l {QtTaskTree::} {sequential}
    execution mode.

    The Storage internals are shared between all of its copies.
    That is why the copies of the Storage object inside the handlers'
    lambda captures still refer to the same Storage instance.
    You may place multiple Storage objects inside one
    \l {QtTaskTree::} {Group} element, provided that they do not
    include copies of the same Storage object. Otherwise, an assert
    is triggered at runtime that includes an error message.
    However, you can place copies of the same Storage object in different
    \l {QtTaskTree::} {Group} elements of the same recipe.
    In this case, the running task tree will create multiple instances
    of the \c StorageStruct objects (one for each copy)
    and storage shadowing will take place. Storage shadowing works in a
    similar way to C++ variable shadowing inside the nested blocks of code:

    \code
        Storage<QString> storage;

        const Group root {
            storage,                            // Top copy, 1st instance of StorageStruct
            onGroupSetup([storage] { ... }),    // Top copy is active
            Group {
                storage,                        // Nested copy, 2nd instance of StorageStruct,
                                                // shadows Top copy
                onGroupSetup([storage] { ... }) // Nested copy is active
            },
            Group {
                onGroupSetup([storage] { ... }) // Top copy is active
            }
        };
    \endcode

    The Storage objects may also be used for passing the initial data
    to the executed task tree, and for reading the final data out of
    the task tree before it finishes. To do this, use
    \l {QTaskTree::} {onStorageSetup()} or
    \l {QTaskTree::} {onStorageDone()}, respectively.

    \note If you use an unreachable Storage object inside the handler,
          because you forgot to place the storage in the recipe,
          or placed it, but not in any handler's ancestor group,
          you may expect a crash, preceded by the following message:
          \e {The referenced storage is not reachable in the running tree.
          A nullptr will be returned which might lead to a crash in the
          calling code. It is possible that no storage was added to the tree,
          or the storage is not reachable from where it is referenced.}

        \li When \a limit equals to 0, there is no limit, and all direct
        child tasks are started together, in the oder in which they appear
        in a group. This means the fully parallel execution, and the
        \l parallel element may be used instead.

        \li When \a limit equals to 1, it means that only one child task
        may run at the time. This means the sequential execution,
        and the \l sequential element may be used instead.
        In this case, child tasks run in chain, so the next child task
        starts after the previous child task has finished.

        \li When other positive number is passed as \a limit, the group's
        child tasks run in parallel, but with a limited number of tasks
        running simultanously. The \e limit defines the maximum number

    \inheaderfile qtasktree.h
    \inmodule TaskTree
    \brief A body element used with For and When constructs.
    \reentrant

    A body element, holding a list of tasks to be executed on each
    \l For iteration or after \l When's barrier was advanced.

    \code
        For (RepeatIterator(5)) >> Do {
            task1,
            task2
        };
    \endcode

    In case of For loop, the Do's body will be executed multiple times.
    If onGroupSetup() or onGroupDone() handlers are a part of passed
    children to Do's constructor, they will be executed just once -
    before the whole loop starts, and after the whole loop is finished:

    \code
        const RepeatIterator iterator(3);

        const auto onSetup = [] { qDebug() << "Setup"; };

        const auto onSync = [iterator] { qDebug() << "Current iteration:" << iterator->iteration(); };

        const auto onDone = [] { qDebug() << "Done"; };

        const Group recipe = For (iterator) >> Do {
            onGroupSetup(onSetup),
            QSyncTask(onSync),
            onDone(onDone)
        };
    \endcode

    The above recipe, when executed, will output:

    \code
        Setup
        Current iteration: 0
        Current iteration: 1
        Current iteration: 2
        Done
    \endcode

    If the intention is to invoke group handlers on each iteration,
    enclose the Do body with an extra \l Group, like:

    \code
        const Group recipe = For (iterator) >> Do {
            Group {
                onGroupSetup(onSetup),
                QSyncTask(onSync),
                onDone(onDone)
            }
        };
    \endcode

    The latter recipe, when executed, will output:

    \code
        Setup
        Current iteration: 0
        Done
        Setup
        Current iteration: 1
        Done
        Setup
        Current iteration: 2
        Done
    \endcode

    The similar happens when the \l Storage passed as a direct child
    of the body. The storage structure is instantiated just once,
    before the whole loop starts, and is destroyed just after the
    whole loop is finished. If the intention is to have separate
    instance of the \l Storage for each iteration, enclose the Do body with
    an extra \l Group.

    Be careful with placing \l parallel element in the Do's body
    of the \l For loop, as all iterations will start in parallel.
    This might not be desired, especially in case of ForeverIterator.

    The output when executing \c sequentialRecipe will be:

    In sequential mode the order of iteration indices in done handlers
    is guaranteed to be preserved.

    The output when executing \c parallelRecipe will be:
    \code

        Starting 1 iteration with timeout 1s seconds.

    In parallel mode the order of iteration indices in done handlers
    isn't guaranteed to be preserved, and depends on the order
    of finished tasks. The returned iteration index inside the parallel
    \l Do body's done handler matches the index of the original iteration

    Describes custom task items within task tree recipes.

    Custom task names are aliased with unique names using the
    QCustomTask template with a given Task, Adapter and Deleter.
    For example, QConcurrentCallTask<T> is an alias to the QCustomTask
    that is defined to work with QConcurrentCall<T> as an associated task class.
    The following table contains custom tasks provided by the TaskTree library
    and their associated task classes:

    \table

        \li Aliased Task Name
        \li Associated Task Class

        \li \c std::chrono::milliseconds
        \li Starts a timer.
    \endtable

    The \c Task template parameter is mandatory, and specifies what type of
    \c Task the running QTaskTree will instantiate when it's a part of recipe.
    The \c Task type needs to be default constructible.

    The \c Adapter template argument is optional. It may be skipped
    if QDefaultTaskAdapter<Task> is fine to adapt the \c Task type.
    Otherwise, the \c Adapter for certain \c Task needs to have the following
    form:

    \code
    class Adapter
    {
    public:
        void operator()(Task *task, QTaskInterface *iface) { ... }
    };
    \endcode

    Implement the operator() above to start the \a task, and call
    QTaskInterface::reportDone() method on the passed \a iface when
    the task is finished.

    It is guaranteed the passed \c Task and QTaskInterface outlives the
    \c Adapter. If necessary, the destructor of \c Adapter may still
    access the passed \c Task.

    For more details see QTaskInterface.

    The \c Deleter template argument is optional. By default,
    the \c std::default_delete<Task> is used.
    The custom \c Deleter is useful when the destructor of the running \c Task
    may potentially block the caller thread. Instead of blocking,
    the custom deleter may move the running task into a separate thread
    and implement the blocking destruction there.
    In this way, the fast destruction (seen from the caller thread)
    of the running task with a blocking destructor may be achieved.

    \sa QTaskInterface
*/

/*!
    \typealias QCustomTask::TaskSetupHandler

    Type alias for \c std::function<SetupResult(Task &)>.

    TaskSetupHandler is an optional argument of a custom task
    element's constructor. Any function with the above signature,
    when passed as a task setup handler, will be called by the running
    task tree after the task is created and before it is started.

    Inside the body of the handler, you may configure the task
    according to your needs. The additional parameters, including storages,
    may be passed to the handler via the lambda capture.
    You can decide dynamically whether the task should be started
    or skipped with success or an error.

    \note Do not start the task inside the start handler by yourself.
    Leave it for QTaskTree, otherwise the behavior is undefined.
    QTaskTree already knows how to start the task thanks
    to the Adapter template parameter passed to the
    QCustomTask<Task, Adapter, Deleter> constructor.

    The return value of the handler instructs the running task tree
    on how to proceed after the handler's invocation is finished.
    The return value of \l {QtTaskTree::} {SetupResult::Continue}
    instructs the task tree to continue running,
    that is, to execute the associated \c Task. The return value of
    \l {QtTaskTree::} {SetupResult::StopWithSuccess}
    or \l {QtTaskTree::} {SetupResult::StopWithError}
    instructs the task tree to skip the task's execution and finish it
    immediately with success or an error, respectively.

    When the return type is either
    \l {QtTaskTree::} {SetupResult::StopWithSuccess}
    or \l {QtTaskTree::} {SetupResult::StopWithError},
    the task's done handler (if provided) isn't called afterwards.

    The constructor of a custom task accepts also functions in the shortened
    form of \c std::function<void(Task &)>, that is, the return value
    is \c void. In this case, it's assumed that the return value is
    \l {QtTaskTree::} {SetupResult::Continue}.

    Type alias for
    \c std::function<QtTaskTree::DoneResult(const Task &, QtTaskTree::DoneWith)>
    or \l {QtTaskTree::} {DoneResult}.

    The TaskDoneHandler is an optional argument of a custom task element's
    constructor. Any function with the above signature, when passed as a
    task done handler, will be called by the running task tree after
    the task execution finished and before the final result of the execution
    is reported back to the parent group.

    Inside the body of the handler you may retrieve the final data from
    the finished task. The additional parameters, including storages,
    may be passed to the handler via the lambda capture.
    It is also possible to decide dynamically whether the task should
    finish with its return value, or the final result should be tweaked.

    The DoneWith argument is optional and your done handler may omit it.
    When provided, it holds the info about the final result of a task
    that will be reported to its parent.

    If you do not plan to read any data from the finished task,
    you may omit the \c {const Task &} argument.

    The returned \l {QtTaskTree::} {DoneResult} value is optional
    and your handler may return \c void instead. In this case,
    the final result of the task will be equal to the value indicated by
    the \l {QtTaskTree::} {DoneResult} argument.
    When the handler returns the \l {QtTaskTree::} {DoneResult}
    value, the task's final result may be tweaked inside
    the done handler's body by the returned value.

    For a TaskDoneHandler of the \l {QtTaskTree::} {DoneResult} type,
    no additional handling is executed, and the task finishes unconditionally
    with the passed value of \l {QtTaskTree::} {DoneResult}.

    When the running task finishes, the task tree invokes a \a done handler,
    with a \c const \e reference to the created task.

    The passed \a setup handler is of the \l TaskSetupHandler type.

            task.setConcurrentCallData(parseAndLog, input);
            // This task will start, and the next one will start after this one finished with success
            return SetupResult::Continue;
        };

        const auto onSecondSetup = [input](QConcurrentCall<void> &task) {

    By default, the \a done handler is invoked whenever the task finishes.

    \fn template <typename StorageStruct, typename Handler> void QTaskTree::onStorageSetup(const QtTaskTree::Storage<StorageStruct> &storage, Handler &&handler)

    Installs a storage setup \a handler for the \a storage to pass
    the initial data dynamically to the running task tree.

    The \c StorageHandler takes a \e reference to the \c StorageStruct instance:

    \code
        static void save(const QString &fileName, const QByteArray &array) { ... }

        Storage<QByteArray> storage;

        const auto onSaverSetup = [storage](QConcurrentCall<QByteArray> &concurrent) {

        taskTree.onStorageSetup(storage, initStorage);
        taskTree.start();
    \endcode

    When the running task tree enters a Group where the \a storage is
    placed in, it creates a \c StorageStruct instance, ready to be used
    inside this group. Just after the \c StorageStruct instance is created,
    and before any handler of this group is called, the task tree invokes
    the passed \a handler. This enables setting up initial content for
    the given storage dynamically. Later, when any group's handler is invoked,
    the task tree activates the created and initialized storage,
    so that it's available inside any group's handler.

/*!
    \fn template <typename StorageStruct, typename Handler> void QTaskTree::onStorageDone(const QtTaskTree::Storage<StorageStruct> &storage, Handler &&handler)

    Installs a storage done \a handler for the \a storage to retrieve
    the final data dynamically from the running task tree.

    The \c StorageHandler takes a \c const \e reference to
    the \c StorageStruct instance:

    \code
        static QByteArray load(const QString &fileName) { ... }

        Storage<QByteArray> storage;

        const auto onLoaderSetup = [](QConcurrentCall<QByteArray> &concurrent) {
            concurrent.setConcurrentCallData(&load, "foo.txt");
        };
        const auto onLoaderDone = [storage](const QConcurrentCall<QByteArray> &concurrent) {
            *storage = concurrent.result();
        };

        const Group root {
            storage,
            QConcurrentCallTask(onLoaderSetup, onLoaderDone, CallDone::OnSuccess)
        };

        };
        taskTree.onStorageDone(storage, collectStorage);
        taskTree.start();
    \endcode

    When the running task tree is about to leave a
    \l {QtTaskTree::} {Group} where the \a storage is placed in,
    it destructs a \c StorageStruct instance.
    Just before the \c StorageStruct instance is destructed, and after
    all possible handlers from this group were called, the task tree
    invokes the passed \a handler. This enables reading the final content
    of the given storage dynamically and processing it further outside of
    the task tree.

    This handler is called also when the running tree is canceled.
    However, it's not called when the running tree is destructed.
